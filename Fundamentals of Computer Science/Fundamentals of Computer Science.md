## "divides" ( $\mid$ )

- $a \; | \; b$ means "a divides b"
$$
b = a \cdot k  
$$
- $a \; | \; b$ gives either true or false and NOT a number

> [!example] 
> $0 | 0 =$ True (but $0 \div 0 =$ indeterminate)
> $5 | 0 =$ False
> $0 | 5 =$ False
> $2 | 4 =$ True
> $4 | 2 =$ False

- If $a \mid b$ and $b \mid a$ then $a = b$
