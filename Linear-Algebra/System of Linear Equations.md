# System of Linear Equations

- A linear equation is an equation in which there are no powers and highest degree of the equation is always one.
- There can any number of variables in a linear equation.

> [!example] 
>> [!header] Linear Equation
> 1. $x - 3y = 5$
> 2. $2x + 4y = 10$
> 3. $3x + 5y = 14$
> 4. $4x - 3y = 1$
> 
>> [!header] Not a Linear Equation
> 1. $x^2 + y = 4$
> 2. $x^2 - xy = 0$ (Two variables must not be multipled)
> 3. $x - yz = 4$
> 4. $\sqrt{x} + y = 2$ ($n^{th}$ roots cause the degree of the equation to be $\frac{1}{n}$)
> 5. $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 15$

- When two or more linear equations are put together, then it is a system of linear equations.
$$
\begin{equation}
x - 3y = -5 
\end{equation}
$$
- Solving the system of linear equations, helps us find out unknowns and variables.
