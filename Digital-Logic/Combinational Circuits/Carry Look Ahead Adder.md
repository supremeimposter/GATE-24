# Carry Look Ahead Adder

- There are two variables defined,
	- Carry Generate $G_i = a_i b_i$ i.e. carry is generated when both bits are 1
	- Carry Propagate $P_i = a_i \oplus b_i$ i.e. carry propagates when both bits are different.


> [!observation] 
> Each output of a circuit can be looked at the perspective of a function. Check for when it will 1 with the help of minterms.
