# Multiplexer
- Multiplexer (MUX) is a data selector which works like a **bridge**.
- Every MUX is a $2^n \times 1$ MUX, where $n$ is the number of select lines or control inputs and there are $2^n$ number of inputs.
- Every MUX has only one output line.

## Implementation of functions using MUX

> [!important] 
> Think of MUX as a bridge


## Functions to MUX

> [!tip] 
> 1. Look at the function carefully and do not use additional variables which are not in the function.
> 2. If you are not getting any idea, then create the canonical forms from the given function.
