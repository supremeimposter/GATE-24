# Boolean Algebraic Function

- A boolean expression is same as a boolean function.

> [!question] 
> Why boolean expression is same as a boolean function?

- It is never possible for a boolean function to be equal to its complement i.e. $f \not= \overline{f}$
- For a function $f$, the complement $\overline{f}$ and the dual $f^d$ can be considered as functions themselves.
- `0` and `1` are constant boolean functions.

## Simplification of Boolean Functions
- A simplified equivalent booean expression means smaller logical circuit with minimum number of gates i.e. reduced literal count.
