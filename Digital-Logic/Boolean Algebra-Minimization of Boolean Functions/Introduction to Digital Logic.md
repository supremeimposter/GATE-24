## Why Binary System?
- We have binary system (base 2) in computers because of the hardware limitations (transistors).
- When a capacitor is charged to 5V, then it holds the binary value `1`. With time, the charge starts to drop in the capacitor, so a range of volt is set to the binary value `1`.

- $2^k$ number of values can be represented using $k$ bits. 

## Positive and Negative Logic System

- Boolean Algebra has only `0` and `1`. It does not know about voltage or any other physical entity.

- $P_1$ and $P_2$ are two persons studying the boolean algebra mapped to voltage differently.

- Positive logic and Negative logic systems are dual of each other.
