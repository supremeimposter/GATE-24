# Addition of Signed Binary Numbers

## Signed Magnitue System

- The sign of the resultant will come from the number of larger magnitude.
- Just add the magnitude.
- If the sign bits are different, then subtraction has to be performed. 
- If the sign bits are same, then addition has to be performed.

## 1's Complement System

- The resultant value is also in 2's complement representation.
$$
A - B = A + (-B) = A + (\text { 1's complement of } B \;)
$$
- Discard the carry over and add $1$ to the result.

## 2's Complement System

- The resultant value is also in 2's complement representation.
$$
A - B = A + (-B) = A + (\text { 2's complement of } B \;)
$$
- Discard the carry over.
