# Overflow
> [!youtube] 
> [Lecture 5A - Overflow Definition, Detection in Signed Magnitude Representation | Digital Logic - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJvjGaiKbcA)

- Overflow depends on the representation of the numbers and the operation that is performed on those numbers.
- Inputs must be within the range. 
- Overflow causes error in results even if the result is within the range.
## Unsigned Addition


## Signed Addition

### Signed Magnitude Representation
- With two operands of opposite signs within the range, overflow never occurs on adding them.

- With two operands of same sign within the range, overflow occurs when there is a carry out of the MSB of the magnitude. 
- If both the MSB of the magnitude are 0s, then there is no overflow.


> [!remember] 
> Magnitude is always unsigned


> [!discussion] Why there is no overflow when the signs are different?
