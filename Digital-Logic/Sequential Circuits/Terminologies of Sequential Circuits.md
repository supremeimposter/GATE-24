# Terminologies of Sequential Circuits

**State of a Flip Flop :**

Present state means before clock
Next state means after clock

**State of a Sequential Circuit :**
- Circuits with [[Flip Flop]] are called sequential circuits.
- The output combination of the flip flops in a sequential circuit is called the state of the sequential circuit.

**State of a Register :**


**State Table and Diagram**


**Next State Equation**


> [!tip] 
> When writing next state equation from state diagram, focus on going to 1.

- Next state equation can be obtained from state table or state diagram.
- Using k-map, a minimized next state equation can be obtained.
