# Asynchronous Counters
- Asynchronous counters are also called as Ripple counter.

## Frequency Division


## Transient States

- Due to the propagational delay of Flip flops, we get glitches called Transient States.
- Transient state occurs momentarily, when two bits are changing.
- LSB changes first and MSB changes next.


## Binary Down Ripple Counter

- For proper functioning of any ripple counter of n flip flops, $n t_{pd} \le t_p$
