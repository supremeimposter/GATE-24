**Pulse Width :**
- Pulse Width or Clock Width is the time duration for which the clock signal is high in a time period.
- It is also called as ON period.

**Duty Cycle :**
- Duty cycle or Power Cycle is the percentage of ON time in a clock period.

$$
\text{Duty Cycle} = \frac{\text{Pulse Width}}{\text{Clock Period}}
$$
