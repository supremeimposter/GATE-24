# Synchronous Counters

## Analysis of Synchronous Counters


| Present State | Next State | Flip Flop Inputs |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
|               |            |                  |

- Flip flops are a function of the current states which are calculated from current states.
- The flip flop inputs are applied on the current state to get the next output.

## Design of Synchronous Counters
> [!NOTE] 
> Design of synchronous counter is the reverse engineering of its analysis.


- Synchronous counters do **NOT** have transient states even when there is no propagation delay in the flip flops.
