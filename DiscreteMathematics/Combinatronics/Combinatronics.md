# Combinatronics
- How to count without counting? 

## Basic Counting Principles

### Sum Rule
- If two sets $A$ and $B$ are disjoint i.e. ${} A \cap B = \phi {}$, then 
$$
\mid A \; \cup \; B \mid = \mid A \mid + \mid B \mid
$$
- If two sets $A$ and $B {}$ are NOT disjoint i.e. ${} A \cap B \not= \phi {}$, then 
$$
\mid A \; \cup \; B \mid \not= \mid A \mid + \mid B \mid
$$
