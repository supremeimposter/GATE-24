# Combinatronics
- How to count without counting? 

## Basic Counting Principles

### Sum Rule
> [!lecture] Lecture-2

- If two sets ${} A$ and $B$ are disjoint i.e. ${} A \cap B = \phi {}$, then 
$$
\mid A \; \cup \; B \mid = \mid A \mid + \mid B \mid
$$
- If two sets $A$ and $B {}$ are NOT disjoint i.e. ${} A \cap B \not= \phi {}$, then 
$$
\mid A \; \cup \; B \mid \not= \mid A \mid + \mid B \mid
$$

### Subtraction Rule
> [!lecture] Lecture-4

- To avoid over-counting.

### Counting by Cases
> [!lecture] Lecture-6

- Mutually exclusive means disjoint.
- Mutually exclusive cases AVOID counting the same object more than one time.
- Exhaustive cases cover all the desired possibilities.
- Mutually exclusive and exhaustive cases are those cases which are disjoint and cover all the cases *i.e. count every object exactly once*.
