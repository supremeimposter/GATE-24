- If P is a propositional variable, then P is necessarily a contingency. Since a propositional variable is either True or False.

## Contingency verification

- To verify for contingency for a given proposition $\alpha$, you somehow make the $\alpha$ True and also make the $\alpha$ False.
- If there is at least one True output and one False output, then the given proposition is a contingency.

- Here for each cases, there are different outputs, meaning the outputs differ as shown in the table
	- If P = True, then $\alpha = Q$
	- If P = False, then $\alpha = \neg Q$

```ad-help
Since the outputs for each case are in the different forms of another variable (q and $\neg$ q), it can be inferred that there are mixed outputs (both True and False).
