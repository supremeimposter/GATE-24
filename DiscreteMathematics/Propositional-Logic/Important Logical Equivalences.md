## Additional Points on Logical Equivalences

- Which connectives are idempotent? Only $\wedge$ and $\vee$ are idempotent.

- Which connectives are commutative? Except implication, every other connectives are commutative.
	![[Pasted image 20230912084540.png]]

- Which connectives are associative? $\wedge$, $\vee$, $\oplus$ and $\leftrightarrow$
	![[Pasted image 20230912084749.png]]

- Which connectives are distributive over another connectives?
	1. $\wedge$ is distributive over $\vee$
	2. $\vee$ is distributive over $\wedge$
	```ad-tip
	If you are not sure about distribution, use 'by-case' method to check the equivalence of distribution between two given logical connectives.
	```

- Which connectives are used for De-morgans' law? Only $\neg$, $\wedge$ and $\vee$.
	- $\wedge$ is converted to $\vee$
	- $\vee$ is converted to $\wedge$
	- $\neg$ P is converted to P and P is converted to $\neg$P
