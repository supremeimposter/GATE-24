- Neither P nor Q $\equiv$ P is false and Q is false $\equiv \neg P \wedge \neg Q$

```ad-question
p : "I will prove this by cases"
q : "There are more than 500 cases"
r : "I can find another way"

1. State $(\neg r \vee \neg q) \rightarrow p$ in simple english
2. State the converse
3. State the inverse
4. State the contrapositive
```

1. $(\neg r \vee \neg q) \rightarrow p \equiv$ "If I cannot find another way or there are not more than 500 cases, then I will prove this by cases." 
2. $p \rightarrow (\neg r \vee \neg q) \equiv$ "If I prove this by cases, then either I cannot find another way or there are not more than 500 cases."
3. $\neg(\neg r \vee \neg q) \rightarrow ~p \equiv (r \wedge q) \rightarrow \neg p \equiv$ "If I can find another way and there are more than 500 cases, then I will not prove this by cases."
4. $\neg p \rightarrow \neg(\neg r \vee \neg q) \equiv \neg p \rightarrow (r \wedge q) \equiv$ "If I don't prove this by cases, then I can find another way and there are more than 500 cases."
