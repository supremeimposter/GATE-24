- Conditionals are claims or contracts.

- $P \rightarrow Q$  and $Q \leftarrow P$  are the same
- But $P \rightarrow Q$ is not same as $Q \rightarrow P$

- P is LHS and Q is RHS of implication

![[Necessary vs Sufficient]]

- If P then Q, is a claim. (If condition, then consequence)
```ad-info
p is also called antecedent, premise, hypothesis.
q is also called consequence, conclusion.
```

- The claim is false only when the condition is satisfied and the consequence is not achieved.
- The claim is true when the consequence is achieved on a satisfied condition.
- If the condition is not satisfied, it doesn't matter whether the consequence is achieved or not. The claim still stands true.

| p   | q   | p $\to$ q |
| --- | --- | --------- |
| T   | T   | T         |
| T   | F   | F         |
| F   | T   | T         |
| F   | F   | T         |

```ad-note
The claim is false only when the consequence is not achieved even the condition is true.
The claim is never false when the condition does not succeed.
```

- All of these English words translate to Implication in logic
	1. If
	2. When
	3. Whenever
	4. Provided that 
	5. Given that
	- All of the above words are same as **if**
### Examples

1. If x is odd, then x is prime 
	- This evaluates to false, since there is some x which is odd, but not prime.
	- 27 is odd, but not prime (3 x 9 = 27).
2. If x is prime, then x is odd
	- This also evaluates to false, since there is some x which is prime, but not odd.
	- 2 is prime, but not odd.
