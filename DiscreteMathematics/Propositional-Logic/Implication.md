- These conditionals are claims.

$P \to Q$ 
$Q \longleftarrow P$
```ad-note
- P is LHS and Q is RHS of implication
```


- If p then q, is a claim. (If condition, then consequence)
- The claim is false only when the condition is satisfied and the consequence is not achieved.
- The claim is true when the consequence is achieved on a satisfied condition.
- If the condition is not satisfied, it doesn't matter whether the consequence is achieved or not. The claim still stands true.

| p   | q   | p $\to$ q |
| --- | --- | --------- |
| T   | T   | T         |
| T   | F   | F         |
| F   | T   | T         |
| F   | F   | T         |

```ad-note
The claim is false only when the consequence is not achieved even the condition is true.
The claim is never false when the condition does not succeed.
