## Analysis of Propositions

### Method 1 - Truth table
- Build truth table along with all the helper columns to verify two (compound) propositions.
- It is inefficient and time-consuming.

### Method 2 - By-case
- Consider cases to check whether two propositions $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are logically equivalent or not.
### Cases choice

- If there are any number of variables in the given two compound propositions, the following choices can be made.
- If there are 2 variables P and Q, then only P can be taken as cases leading to 2 cases, or both P and Q can be taken as cases leading to 4 cases.
- In each case, both propositions $\alpha$ and $\beta$ must be equal. Even if one of the cases fail, then stop going for further cases, as they are not logically equivalent.

- Example 4
	- Solving with 4 cases

	- Solving with 2 cases

- Example 6 
	- If they are not logically equivalent, then their bi-implication is a contradiction.
