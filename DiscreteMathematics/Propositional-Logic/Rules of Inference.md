- These are the frequently used valid argument forms
- These define how can we correctly infer new information from existing information.

## Table of Rules of Inference

- `Modus ponens` is "sufficient condition" of implication
- `Modus tollens` is contra-positive of implication
- `Simplification` is also called as `Conjunctive syllogism`
- Hypothetical syllogism is simply the transitive property of implication

P : "Henry works hard"
Q : "Henry is a dull boy"
R : "Henry will get the job"

$$
\begin{array}{}
P\\
P \rightarrow Q \\
Q \rightarrow \neg R\\
\therefore \neg R
\end{array}
$$

- Make the RHS false, then R must be True
- Now we have to make all the premises true to prove that this is a invalid argument.
- Since R is true $Q \rightarrow \neg R$ becomes False, so it is not possible to make all the premises true
- Hence, this is a valid argument.
