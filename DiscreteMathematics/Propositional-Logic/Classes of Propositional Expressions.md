In compound propositions, there are three classes of propositions
1. [[Tautology in PL]] 
2. [[Contradiction]]
3. [[Contingency]]

- These 3 classes are mutually exclusive.
- Contingency is neither tautology nor contradiction. It has at least one True **and** at least one False.

```ad-info
In propositional logic, 

- **Valid** means Tautology or always true
- **Invalid** means NOT tautology or contingency or contradiction

- **satisfiable** means either tautology or contingency or at least true once
- **unsatisfiable** means contradiction or always false
- **falsifiable** means NOT valid or NOT tautology or contradiction or contingency

```

- Truth table can also be used to verify whether a compound proposition is a Tautology or Contradiction or Contingency.
