In compound propositions, there are three classes of propositions
1. Tautology 
2. Contradiction
3. Contingency

- These 3 classes are mutually exclusive.
- Contingency is neither tautology nor contradiction.

- Truth table can also be used to verify whether a compound proposition is a Tautology or Contradiction or Contingency.

## Logical Equivalence $\Leftrightarrow$ or $\equiv$

- If two (compound) propositions or expressions $\alpha$, $\beta$ have the same truth table or if they are equal for all cases, then they are logically equivalent.
- If $\alpha$, $\beta$ are logically equivalent $\alpha \equiv \beta$, if and only if their $\alpha \leftrightarrow \beta$ is a tautology. But if they are not logically equivalent, then they are contradiction.

## Analysis of Propositions

### Method 1
- Build truth table along with all the helper columns to verify two (compound) propositions.
- It is inefficient and time-consuming.

### Method 2
- Consider cases to check whether two propositions $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are logically equivalent or not.
### Cases choice

- If there are any number of variables in the given two compound propositions, the following choices can be made.
- If there are 2 variables P and Q, then only P can be taken as cases leading to 2 cases, or both P and Q can be taken as cases leading to 4 cases.
- In each case, both propositions $\alpha$ and $\beta$ must be equal. Even if one of the cases fail, then stop going for further cases, as they are not logically equivalent.

- Example 4
	- Solving with 4 cases

	- Solving with 2 cases

- Example 6 
	- If they are not logically equivalent, then their bi-implication is a contradiction.
