## Logical Equivalence $\Leftrightarrow$ or $\equiv$

- If two (compound) propositions or expressions $\alpha$, $\beta$ have the same truth table or if they are equal for all cases, then they are logically equivalent.
- If $\alpha$, $\beta$ are logically equivalent $\alpha \equiv \beta$, if and only if their $\alpha \leftrightarrow \beta$ is a tautology. But if they are not logically equivalent, then they are contradiction.
- If $\alpha \leftrightarrow \beta$ is a tautology ($\alpha \equiv \beta$), then $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$ is a tautology and $\beta \rightarrow \alpha$ is a tautology.
