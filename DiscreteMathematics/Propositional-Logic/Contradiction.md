## Contradiction verification

### Method 1 - Truth table
- Construct truth table and verify if all the values are False.

### Method 2 - By-case 
- If all the cases are False, then the given proposition is a contradiction.

### Method 3 - Simplification
- Usage of all the [[Important Logical Equivalences]] to simplify the given proposition $\alpha$ to see if the result if false. If the simplification does not result to false, then it is not a contradiction.

### Method 4 - Implication 
- This method is only for propositions with [[Implication]].
- Make either the LHS of the implication false or the RHS of the implication true, then it is verified that the given proposition $\alpha$ is NOT a contradiction, because this proves there is a case of true output.
