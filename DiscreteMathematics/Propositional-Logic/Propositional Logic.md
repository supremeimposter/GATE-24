- A proposition cannot contain both true and false, it can only be either true or false but **never** both
- Proposition is a declarative (assertive) statement which states a fact.
- It doesn't matter where an assertive sentence is true or false. The only thing that matters is whether it is a proposition or not.
- Interrogative, Exclamatory and Imperative sentences are **never** propositions.

```ad-important
When a sentence has a variable it can NEVER be a proposition

For example: "Let 2x = 3 + 3x" cannot be a proposition, since sentences with propositions contradicts itself. *self-contradictory paradox*

Questions such as "the given sentence is proposition or not" will never be asked in any standard examinations such as GATE.

## Propositional Variables

A propositional variables holds a proposition and evaluates to either true or false.

## Types of Proposition

1. Atomic proposition : truth value does not depend on any other proposition. they can never be broken down into multiple propositions.
2. Compound proposition : Multiple atomic propositions connected by logical connectives which can be decomposed (broken down) into multiple atomic propositions
