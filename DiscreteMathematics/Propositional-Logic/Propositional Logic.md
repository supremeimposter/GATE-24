- A proposition cannot contain both true and false, it can only be either true or false but **never** both
- Proposition is a declarative (assertive) statement which states a fact.
- It doesn't matter where an assertive sentence is true or false. The only thing that matters is whether it is a proposition or not.
- Interrogative, Exclamatory and Imperative sentences are **never** propositions.

```ad-important
- When a sentence has a variable it can NEVER be a proposition

For example: "Let 2x = 3 + 3x" cannot be a proposition, because the truth value depends on the variable x. But when a compound proposition has variable x in both atomic proposition, then it is a proposition. [[Implication#^22cc0d]]
- When a sentence is *self-contradictory paradox*, it is NOT a proposition.

```ad-attention
"2 + 3", "Grass" are NOT propositions, because they do not state any fact
```

```ad-warning
Questions such as "the given sentence is proposition or not" will never be asked in any standard examinations such as GATE.

## Propositional Variables

- A propositional variables holds a proposition and evaluates to either true or false.
- There are only two truth values : True, False

## Types of Proposition

1. Atomic proposition : truth value does not depend on any other proposition. they can never be broken down into multiple propositions.
2. Compound proposition : Multiple atomic propositions connected by logical connectives which can be decomposed (broken down) into multiple atomic propositions

## Truth Table

- Truth table tells whether a compound statement is true or false.
- For 'n' propositional variables, there are $2^n$ truth value combinations. 
- The order of the combinations does not matter. But a standard order of binary numbers can be followed to avoid confusion in which 0 means False and 1 means True.
