- It is also known as First Order Predicate Calculus or Predicate Logic or Quantificational Logic.
- First Order logic overcomes the [[Limitations of Propositional Logic |limitations]] that propositional logic poses.
- We need a better logic for our real world that deals with objects, the domain in which they reside, their properties, the relationship between various objects, the transformations (functions) on objects and quantification (reason about multiple objects).
