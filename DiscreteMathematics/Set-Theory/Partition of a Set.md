# Partition of a Set

> [!youtube] [Partition of a Set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6Azf1wPYg4)


> [!quote] What is a partition of a set?
> A partition of a set is a way of splitting the set into disjoint, non empty subsets so that every element belongs to exactly one subset.

- A partition of a set is a set $A$.
- All the elements of partition of a set $A$ are subsets of $A$.
- $\text{If } a \in \text{partition of } A, \text{ then } a \subseteq A$.
- A partition is represented by $\Pi$.

## Properties of a Partition


## Number of partitions of a Set
- For a base set $A$, if the $|A| = k$ then, the partitions $\Pi$ will be as follows
	- `1`- part partition
	- `2`- part partition
	- $\ldots$
	- `k`- part partition

> [!NOTE] There is no general formula for number of partitions of a set.

- While counting for the number of partitions of a set, follow a systematic manner to avoid confusion.
