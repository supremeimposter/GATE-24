- TOSET or Total Order or Chain or Linear Order or Straight line
- The hasse diagram for TOR is always a straight linear chain, since every two elements in the base set is related to each other.

- If a hasse diagram is a single linear chain, then that means all the elements are comparable and it is a total order relation.
