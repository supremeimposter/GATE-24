- Set is a collection of any elements.
- The elements don't have to have any correlation between them and even sets can be elements of a set.

## Properties of Set
- Set Properties - unordered and distinct elements
	- Duplicates are not counted in a set, only distinct elements are counted.
	- Order of the elements does not matter in a set. They can be written in any order.


> [!question] How many elements does the following set contain?
> S = {a, b, a, a, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3}
>> [!info]- Answer
>> The set contains 5 elements

## Set Membership
- If an object x "belongs to" a set S then, $x \in S$
- If an object y "does not belong to" a set S then, $y \not\in S$

- `X` $\not=$ { `X` } i.e. An element is not same as the element in a set.

## Infinite and Finite Sets
- **Finite set** = set whose no of elements is a whole number.
- **Infinite set** = set whose no of elements is not whole number.

> [!brain] $\infty$ is not a number, it is a concept
> $+\infty$ or $-\infty$ $\not\in$ any set.


## Cardinality of a set
- Cardinality of a set $S$ is the number of element it contains. It is denoted by $|S|$
- Let $S$ = {$\phi$, {a, b}, 1, 5, 6}, $|S| = 5$ . i.e. A subset is counted as an element.
- Let $\mathbb{Z}$ be the set of all integers such that $|\mathbb{Z}| = \infty$

## Null set
- Also called as empty set of void set.
- It is denoted by $\phi$ or $\{\}$.
- $|\{\}| = |\phi| = 0$

> [!note] 
> $\phi \not= \{ \phi \}$
> $|\{ \phi \}| = 1$
