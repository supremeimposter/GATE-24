# Subset Relation
> [!lecture] Lecture-60

> [!cases] 
>Let $A$ be a subset of powerset of a set $S$ i.e. $A \subseteq \mathcal{P}(S)$.

>Let $A$ be the powerset of a set $S$ i.e. $A = \mathcal{P}(S)$.


- $(\mathcal{P}(S), \subseteq)$ is a boolean lattice
- LUB = Union
- GLB = Intersection
- Greatest = $S$
- Least = $\phi$
