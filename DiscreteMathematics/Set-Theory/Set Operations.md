# Set Operations

> [!NOTE] The resultant of set operations is again a set

### Set Union ($\cup$)
- "$A \cup B$ is the **smallest** set of $S$ which has $A$ and $B$ as subsets" is another way to define Unions

### Set Intersection ($\cap$)


### Set Difference ($\textbackslash$ or $-$)


### Set Symmetric Difference ($\Delta$ or $\oplus$)


### Set Cross Product ($\times$)
- Cross Product $\times$ is the ordered pairs of elements of both sets.

## Understanding Set Operations
- Use logic and venn diagrams to interpret the given data about sets.
- Draw venn diagrams and mark areas with numbers for easier understanding.
- Truth table can be used to interpret cases of where an element is false.
- For complements, De-Morgan's laws can be used.

## Standard Results on Set Operations


----
# Equality of Sets

- $A = B$, iff $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$
