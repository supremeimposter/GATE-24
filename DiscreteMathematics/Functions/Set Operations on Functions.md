# Set Operations on Functions
> [!lecture] Lecture-6

- A relation is a subset of cross-product of two sets $\therefore$ A relation is a set so as is a function.
- [[Set Operations]] can be performed on functions.


## Composition of Functions
> [!lecture] Lecture-7

$$
f \circ g = f(g(x))
$$
![[Pasted image 20231101080000.png|$f \circ g$]]

$$
f : A \rightarrow B
$$
$$
g : M \rightarrow N
$$
- Co-domain of $g$ is the domain of $f$.

- If $f, g$ are both one-one, then $f \circ g$ is also one-one.
- If $f, g$ are both onto, then $f \circ g$ is also onto.
