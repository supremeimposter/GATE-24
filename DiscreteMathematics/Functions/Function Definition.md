# Function
- A function is a special type of relation.
- A function is also called as Mapping or Transformation.
> [!definition] 
> A function is a binary relation from $A$ to $B$ in which every element in $A$ is related to exactly one element in $B$ 

## Terminologies
- $A$ is called **Domain**
- $B$ is called **Co-domain**
$$
f : A \rightarrow B
$$
$$
f (a) = b, \text{where } a \in A \text{ and } b \in B
$$

- **Image** of an element is unique.
- Image of $a$ under $f$ is $b$ 
- **Pre-image** of an element is a set of elements.
- Pre-image of $b$ under $f$ is $a$

- **Range** is the set of elements that can be reached in the co-domain from the domain.
- Range is a subset of co-domain.
- If the domain is non-empty, then the range is non-empty.
