# Function
> [!lecture] Lecture-1

- A function is a special type of relation.
- A function is also called as Mapping or Transformation.
> [!definition] 
> A function is a binary relation from $A$ to $B$ in which every element in $A$ is related to exactly one element in $B$ 
- Every function is a relation but not all relations are functions.

## Terminologies

### Domain and Co-domain
- $A$ is called **Domain**
- $B$ is called **Co-domain**
$$
f : A \rightarrow B
$$
$$
f (a) = b, \text{where } a \in A \text{ and } b \in B
$$

### Image and Pre-image
- **Image** of an element is unique.
- Image of $a$ under $f$ is $b$ 
- **Pre-image** of an element is a set of elements.
- Pre-image of $b$ under $f$ is $a$

### Range
- **Range** is the set of elements that can be reached in the co-domain from the domain.
- Range is a subset of co-domain.
- If the domain is non-empty, then the range is non-empty.

### Image for a subset of Domain
> [!lecture] Lecture-3
- $f(\text{Domain}) = \text{Co-domain}$


## Addition or Multiplication of two functions


## Number of functions
> [!lecture] Lecture-2

- For a domain $A$ of $\mid A \mid = n$ and co-domain $B$ of $\mid B \mid = m$ 
- Every element in $A$ has $m$ choices.
- The number of functions possible $= m^n = \mid co-domain\mid^{\mid domain \mid}$ 
$$
\begin{equation}
= (m \times m \times m \times \ldots \times m)_{n} \\
= m^n
\end{equation}
$$

## Representation of Functions
> [!lecture] Lecture-3

### Set Representation

### Arrow Representation

### Matrix Representation

- Every row must have exactly one tick mark.

### Tabular Representation



## [[Set Operations on Functions]]

## [[Inverse of Functions]]
