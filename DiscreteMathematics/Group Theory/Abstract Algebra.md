# Abstract Algebra
Abstract Algebra is the study of abstract mathematical structures.

## Algebraic Structure (AS)
> [!lecture] Lecture-3

$$
AS = (\text{base set}, \text{operations})
$$
- A non empty set with one or more closed operations is the Algebraic Structure.

- [[Lattice]]
- Boolean Algebra
- Ring
- Field
- Vector


## Algebraic Structure with single binary operation
- For a single base set, there is a single binary operation.
- There are certain [[Properties|properties]] of algebraic structures.

> [!doubt] 
> If the given set is closed under the binary operation, then it is an algebraic structure. No need to consider other properties such as associative, identity, etc...
>> Answer : Yes and it is Magma structure

### Classification of Algebraic Structures with single binary operation
> [!lecture] Lecture-11

- Magma (Groupoid)
- Quasigroup
- [[Monoid]]
- Semi-group
- Group

- If any magma satisfies [[Properties#Commutative Property|commutative]] property, then it is called abelian magma.

- Order of Algebraic Structure is the cardinality of the base set.
