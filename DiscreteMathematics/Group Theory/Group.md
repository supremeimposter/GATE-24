# Group


## Properties of Group
> [!lecture] Lecture-18
- The identity element is unique.
- The inverse of identity element is identity element itself.
- Every element has unique inverse.
- Group has both left and right cancellation property.
- $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$ 
- $(ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}$ 
- Only in an abelian group, the below exists.
$$
\begin{align}
a \star b = b \star c \\
a \star b = c \star b \\ \\
\therefore a = c
\end{align}

## Examples
### Set of nth roots of unity under multiplication
> [!lecture] Lecture-16

#### 1's root of unity
$$
x = 1
$$

#### square root of unity
$$
x ^2 = 1
$$

#### cube roots of unity
$$
x ^ 3 = 1
$$

#### 4th roots of unity
$$
x^4 = 1
$$


#### nth roots of unity
$$x ^ n = 1$$

> [!summary] 
>  - For all $n \ge 1$ nth roots of unity are abelian group under multiplication.
