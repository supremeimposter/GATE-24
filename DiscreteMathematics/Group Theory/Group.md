# Group


## Properties of Group
> [!lecture] Lecture-18, 21

- The identity element is unique.
- A group or sub-group cannot be empty, since it should at least contain the identity element.
- The inverse of identity element is identity element itself.

> [!think] 
> If inverse of an element is itself, then it does NOT mean that it is the identity element of the group.

- Only group structure has inverse property.
- Every element has unique and only inverse in a group.
- Group has both left and right cancellation property.
- ${} (a^{-1})^{-1} = a$ 
- $(ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}$ 
- Only in an abelian group, the below exists.
$$
\begin{align}
a \star b = b \star c \\
a \star b = c \star b \\ \\
\therefore a = c
\end{align}
$$

- $a\;x = b$ has a unique solution $x = a^{-1}\;b$
- $x\;a = b$ has a unique solution $x = b\;a^{-1}$
- If $a \star b = e$, then $a$ and b are inverses of each other.

## Power of an element in a Group
> [!lecture] Lecture-26
- For a group $(G, \star)$,  $\forall a \in G$
	- $a^0 = e$
	- $a^n = a^{n - 1} \star a, \; \text{ for } n \ge 1$
	- $a^{-n} = (a^{-1})^{n},\; \text{ for } n \ge 1 {}$


> [!conflict] 
> Power of an element in a group is different from Order of an element in a group.

## Groups of Small Order
> [!lecture] Lecture-25A

> [!intuition] 
> Number of non-isomorphic groups of order `n` is the number of abstract templates of groups of order `n`.

### Groups of Order 1
- All the groups of order 1 are isomorphic i.e. they all have the same structure.
- There is only one non-isomorphic group of order 1, which is a abstract template of groups of order 1.
- Every order 1 group is an abelian group.

### Groups of Order 2
- Only one template group of order 2.
- Every order 2 group is abelian group.

### Groups of Order 3
- Only one template group of order 3.
![[Group#cube roots of unity]]

### Groups of Order 4
> [!lecture] Lecture-25B

- There are two template groups of order 4.
	- <u>Template 1</u> : One element is the inverse of itself and the other two are inverses of each other.
	- <u>Template 2</u> : All the elements are the inverses of each other.
- Every order 4 group is an abelian group.
- Order 4 groups are NOT cyclic.
	- Only template 1 is cyclic in groups of order 4.

## Sub-Group
> [!lecture] Lecture-27A, 34
>> [!youtube] [Lecture 34 - Practice Question on Subgroup of a Group | Group Theory | Discrete Mathematics | Deepak - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge0kvkFA_qA)

- A subset ${} H$ of a group $G$ which is also a group under the same binary operation $\star$ 
- The subset must contain,
	- Identity element $e$
	- Inverse of all the elements in the subset
	- The powers of an element must be in the subset because of closure property
	- The subset must be closed under the binary operation $\star {}$ 

> [!info] Associativity does not need to be checked if it contains the above things in the subset

## Sub-group generated by an element
> [!lecture] Lecture-27B, 31

>
>> [!youtube] [Lecture 30 - Practice Question - Multiplication Modulo Group Un | Group Theory |Discrete Mathematics - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz-kbP1_QHs)

- Sub-group generated by an element ${} a \in G$ is the *smallest* sub-group of $G$ that contains the element $a$.
$$\langle a \rangle = \{a^n\mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$$
 - An element $g \in G$ is generator of the group $G$ iff $\langle g \rangle = G$
 - If $g^{-1} = h$, then $\langle h \rangle = G$
- In any group, $\langle e \rangle = \{e\}$
- If $a, a^{-1} \in G$, then $\langle a \rangle = \langle a^{-1} \rangle {}$

> [!conflict] 
> Sub-group of a group and sub-group generated by an element of a group are different.

## Order of an Element in a group

> [!lecture] Lecture-32A, 32B

- Order of an element in a group is the size of the sub-group generated by that element.
- It is also called as Period Length or Period.
- Order of an element is always a positive integer ${} \ge 1 {}$
- If ${} G$ is a group and an element $a \in G$, then order of the element $a$ is,
$$\mid a \mid = \mid \langle a \rangle \mid = \mid \{a^n\mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\} \mid$$
- $\mid a \mid$ is the smallest positive integer $r$ such that $a^r = e$ where $a^{r - 1}$ is the inverse of $a$. i.e $\mid a \mid = r$
- In a group,  $\mid e \mid= 1 {}$ i.e. Order of an identity element is always $1 {}$.

- If the identity element is found in the positive powers, then negative powers do not need to be searched.
- In a finite group, order of every element is finite, so no need to check for negative powers as well. 
- In an infinite group, order of elements can be either finite or infinite.

---
## Cyclic Group
> [!lecture] Lecture-33

- A group that can be generated by a single element in that group.
- A group with at least one generator.
- Every cyclic group is abelian.
- Every cyclic group ${} G$ is of the form, where $g \in G$ is the generator of $G$
$$
G = \{g^n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\} = \{(g^{-1})^n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\}
$$
> [!lecture] Lecture-36B
- If a group is NOT cyclic, then the group does not contain any generator.
- Every two cyclic groups of the same order are isomorphic.
- Any cyclic group is isomorphic to either ${} \mathbb{Z} {}$ or ${} \mathbb{Z}_n {}$.

> [!doubt] 
> - ${} \langle g \rangle {}$ is a cyclic subgroup of ${} G {}$ generated by $g {}$.
> - ${} \langle g \rangle$ is a subgroup of $g$ generated by $g {}$.

> [!header] Number of Generators
- Every element has only one and unique inverse in a group.

> [!claim]

- ${} (Z_n, \oplus_n) {}$ of any order is always a cyclic group.

## Lagrange's Theorem
> [!lecture] Lecture-36

- If ${} H {}$ is a sub-group of a finite group $G {}$, then ${} \mid H \mid {}$ divides  ${} \mid G \mid {}$
$$
\frac{\mid G \mid}{\mid H \mid} \in \mathbb{N}
$$
- But the converse is NOT true.
- The converse of Lagrange's Theorem is true for an abelian group.
- Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.

- A group $G {}$ is abelian iff ${} (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 \;\;\forall a, b \in G {}$
- Every sub-group of an abelian group is abelian.

## Intersection of Sub-groups

- Union of two sub-groups may NOT be a sub-group.

- Unit Group n $(U_n, \otimes)$ structure is obtained from [[Monoid#Multiplicative Modulo n|Multiplicative modulo n]] by picking the units that has inverses.
- $U_n$ is the set of all positive integers less than `n` that are relatively prime to `n`.
- Identity element for multiplication $e = 1$ 
- The elements which have multiplicative inverses are also co-primes to $n$.
- The base set of Unit group contains only co-primes to $n$.
- This structure is an abelian group.
