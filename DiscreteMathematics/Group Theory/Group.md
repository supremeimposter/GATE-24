# Group


## Properties of Group
> [!lecture] Lecture-18, 21
- The identity element is unique.
- The inverse of identity element is identity element itself.
- Only group structure has inverse property.
- Every element has unique inverse in a group.
- Group has both left and right cancellation property.
- $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$ 
- $(ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}$ 
- Only in an abelian group, the below exists.
$$
\begin{align}
a \star b = b \star c \\
a \star b = c \star b \\ \\
\therefore a = c
\end{align}
$$

- $a\;x = b$ has a unique solution $x = a^{-1}\;b$
- $x\;a = b$ has a unique solution $x = b\;a^{-1}$
- If $a \star b = e$, then and b are inverses of each other.

## Groups of Small Order
> [!lecture] Lecture-25A

> [!intuition] 
> Number of non-isomorphic groups of order `n` is the number of abstract templates of groups of order `n`.

### Groups of Order 1
- All the groups of order 1 are isomorphic i.e. they all have the same structure.
- There is only one non-isomorphic group of order 1, which is a abstract template of groups of order 1.
- Every order 1 group is an abelian group.

### Groups of Order 2
- Only one template group of order 2.
- Every order 2 group is abelian group.

### Groups of Order 3
- Only one template group of order 3.
![[Group#cube roots of unity]]

### Groups of Order 4
> [!lecture] Lecture-25B

- There are two template groups of order 4.
	- <u>Template 1</u> : One element is the inverse of itself and the other two are inverses of each other.
	- <u>Template 2</u> : All the elements are the inverses of each other.
- Every order 4 group is an abelian group.

## Power of an element in a Group
> [!lecture] Lecture-26
- For a group $(G, \star)$,  $\forall a \in G$
	- $a^0 = e$
	- $a^n = a^{n - 1} \star a, \; \text{ for } n \ge 1$
	- $a^{-n} = (a^{-1})^{n},\; \text{ for } n \ge 1$

## Sub-Group
> [!lecture] Lecture-27A

- A subset $H$ of a group $G$ which is also a group under the same binary operation $\star$ 
- The subset must contain,
	- Identity element $e$
	- Inverse of all the elements in the subset
	- The powers of an element must be in the subset because of closure property
	- The subset must be closed under the binary operation $\star$ 

> [!info] Associativity does not need to be checked if it contains the above things in the subset

### Sub-group generated by an element
> [!lecture] Lecture-27B, 31

>> [!youtube] [Lecture 30 - Practice Question - Multiplication Modulo Group Un | Group Theory |Discrete Mathematics - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz-kbP1_QHs)

- Sub-group generated by an element $a \in G$ is the *smallest* sub-group of $G$ that contains the element $a$.
$$\langle a \rangle = \{a^n\mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$$
 - An element $g \in G$ is generator of the group $G$ iff $\langle g \rangle = G$
- In any group, $\langle e \rangle = \{e\}$
- If $a, a^{-1} \in G$, then $\langle a \rangle = \langle a^{-1} \rangle$

## Analysis of some groups
### Set of nth roots of unity under multiplication
> [!lecture] Lecture-16

#### 1's root of unity
$$
x = 1
$$

#### Square root of unity
$$
x ^2 = 1
$$

#### Cube roots of unity
$$
x ^ 3 = 1
$$

#### 4th roots of unity
$$
x^4 = 1
$$


#### nth roots of unity
$$x ^ n = 1$$

> [!summary] 
>  - For all $n \ge 1$ nth roots of unity are abelian group under multiplication.


### Additive Modulo n
> [!lecture] Lecture-17

$$
(Z_n = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n - 1\}, \oplus_n)
$$

### Unit Group n

- Unit Group n $(U_n, \otimes)$ structure is obtained from [[Monoid#Multiplicative Modulo n|Multiplicative modulo n]] by picking the units that has inverses.
- $U_n$ is the set of all positive integers less than `n` that are relatively prime to `n`.
- Identity element for multiplication $e = 1$ 
- The elements which have multiplicative inverses are also co-primes to $n$.
- The base set of Unit group contains only co-primes to $n$.
- This structure is an abelian group.
