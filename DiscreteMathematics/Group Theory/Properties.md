# Closure Property
> [!lecture] Lecture-4

- Operation on any two elements in the base set (same or different), the result must be an element from the base set.
- $(S, \#)$ satisfy closure property iff $\forall a, b \in S \; a \# b \in S$ 


## Operation table
- Operation table is used to check the closure property.
- Read as "row operation column"


## Binary Operation
- $\#$ is binary operation on base set iff base set is closed under the operation $\#$.
