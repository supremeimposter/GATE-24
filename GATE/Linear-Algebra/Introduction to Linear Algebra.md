# Introduction to Linear Algebra

- LA is a tool to work with matrices which help the machines in understanding the data.

- Scalar – a number with magnitude 
- Vector – a number with magnitude and dimension

> [!NOTE]
> Scalar $\times$ Scalar = Scalar
> Vector $\times$ Vector = Vector
> Scalar $\times$ Vector = Vector (Vector gets scaled)

a. Matrix multiplied by a vector is again a vector.
$$
\text {Matrix} \times \text{Vector} = \text{Vector}
