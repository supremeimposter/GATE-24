## Diagonal Matrix
Diagonal matrix does not necessarily need to be square matrices. Only the principal diagonal must be non-zeros.

## Symmetric Matrix

## Skew Symmetric Matrix
The diagonal elements has to be all 0s, because the matrix has to be flipped over the principal diagonal.

For any matrix $A$, both $AA^T$ and $A^TA$ are symmetric.
For any matrix $A$ with real number entries, 
1. $A + A^T$ is a symmetric matrix
2. $A - A^T$ is a skew symmetric matrix.


## Orthogonal Matrix

> [!tip] 
> Orthogonal is used for matrix, but orthonormal is only for vectors, not matrices.


## Idempotent Matrix



## Involutory Matrix



## Conjugate Transpose of a Matrix


## Hermitian Matrix

Main diagonal values of hermitian matrix are real.

## Skew Hermitian Matrix

Main diagonal values of skew hermitian matrix are imaginary.
