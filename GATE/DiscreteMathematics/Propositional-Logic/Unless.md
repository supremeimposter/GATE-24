### Examples

1. Jen won't go to the party unless Mary goes to the party
	- p : "Jen won't go the party"
	- q : "Mary goes to the party"
	- $\neg q \rightarrow p$ : "If Mary does not go to the party, then Jen won't go to the party."

2. I won't study unless you complete my demand
	- p : "I won't study"
	- q : "You complete my demand"
	- $\neg q \rightarrow p$ : "If you do not complete my demand, then I won't study."

```ad-hint
- p is the intention and q is just a chance and not a guarantee
- Even if q is satisfied, then p is not guaranteed
```

## Unless with conditional statements

$$
(P \rightarrow Q) \text{ UNLESS } R \equiv (P \rightarrow Q) \text{ OR } R \equiv \neg R \rightarrow (P \rightarrow Q)
$$
$$
\text{Let } \alpha = (P \rightarrow Q)
$$
$$
\alpha \text{ UNLESS } R \equiv \alpha \text{ OR } R \equiv \neg R \rightarrow \alpha
$$

1. If you don't leave early, you'll miss the train unless the train is late
	- P : "you leave early"
	- Q : "You will miss the train"
	- R : "The train is late"
	- $\neg R \rightarrow (\neg P \rightarrow Q) \equiv$ "If the train is not late, then if you don't leave early, then you will miss the train" 
	- $(\neg P \rightarrow Q) \vee R$ $\equiv$ "If you don't leave early, then you'll miss the train or the train is late" 

2. If you study well, you'll crack GATE exam unless you make silly mistakes
	- P : "You study well"
	- Q : "You will crack GATE exam"
	- R : "You make silly mistakes"
	- $\neg R \rightarrow (P \rightarrow Q) \equiv$ "If you do not make silly mistakes, then if you study well, then you'll crack GATE exam"
	- $(P \rightarrow Q) \vee Q \equiv$ "If you study well, then you'll crack GATE exam or you will make silly mistakes"

3. You cannot ride the roller coaster if you are under 4 feet tall unless you are older than 16 years old
	- P : "You can ride the roller coaster"
	- Q : "You are under 4 feet tall"
	- R : "You are older than 16 years old"
	- $\neg R \rightarrow (Q \rightarrow \neg P) \equiv$ "If you are not older than 16 years old, then if you are under 4 feet tall, then you cannot ride the roller coaster"
	- $(Q \rightarrow \neg P) \vee R$ "If you are under 4 feet tall, then you cannot ride the roller coaster or you are older than 16 years old"
