## Satisfiable and Unsatisfiable

![[Pasted image 20230912153220.png]]

- If the compound propositions $\alpha$ takes up True inputs to its variables and turns out to be true at least once, then the compound proposition $\alpha$ is **satisfiable**.
- The input should be true and try to make it true at least once.

- **Unsatisfiable** can never be true for any combination of inputs to the variables of compound proposition $\alpha$. It is contradiction (false for whatever the input is)

- If $\alpha$ is a satisfiable, then it is either tautology or contingency. But the converse is not true.

### Example

- Try to make the given proposition $\alpha$ true

- Check which variable can hold truth values inside each brackets. One true is enough to make each bracket's truth value as true,since it is dis-junction inside each bracket.

a. p = true, q = false, r = false
b. p = true, q = false, r = true, s = false

---
## Falsifiable

- A compound proposition $\alpha$ which can be made false at least once by a combination of inputs.

- The complement of falsifiable can be either tautology or contingency which means satisfiable. That's why options 1 and 2 are not checked.
