# Special types of functions
> [!lecture] Lecture-4

## One-One function 
- Every different element in the domain must have different image in the co-domain.
- It is also called **Injection** or Injunctive function or Injunction.
- If $\mid domain \mid \gt \mid co-domain \mid$ , then one-one function  is NOT possible.

### Prove one-one


## Onto function
- Co-domain = Range
- Every element in co-domain has at least one pre-image.
- It is also called subjective or surjection.
- If $\mid domain \mid \lt \mid co-domain \mid$ , then onto function  is NOT possible.

### Prove onto


## Bijective function
- A function that is both injective and surjective. 
- It is also called as one-one correspondence between two sets.
- Bijective function exists iff $\mid domain \mid\; = \;\mid co-domain \mid$
