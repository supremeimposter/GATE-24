# Propagation Delay and Timing Diagrams

When the input to a logic gate is changed, the output will not change instantaneously. The transistors or other switching elements within the gate take a finite time to react to a change in input, so that the change in the gate output is delayed with respect to the input change.

> The input may change suddenly, but output will take some time to react to the input.

If the change in output is delayed by time ɛ, with respect to the input, we say that this gate has a propagation delay of ɛ. The propgational delay is also denoted by $\delta$ or $\Delta$.

If a digital circuit has a propagational delay of $2 \mathrm{ns}$, then the ideal output waveform is shifted by $2 \mathrm{ns}$.

There is always a negligible delay to change the inputs in the digital circuits.

| $T_{\text{P}}$   | Propagational Delay                                  |
| $T_{\text{PLH}}$ | Propagational Delay when input goes from low to high |
| $T_{\text{PHL}}$ | Propagational Delay when input goes from high to low |

Practically $T_{\text{PLH}} \not= T_{\text{PHL}}$ in digital circuits.

> [!header] Assumptions about Propagation Delay

- We assume the wire propagation delay to be $0$ nanoseconds.
- We assume that inputs can be changed immediately with no propagational delay.
- Practically $T_{\text{PLH}} \not= T_{\text{PHL}}$ but we assume that $T_{\text{PLH}} = T_{\text{PHL}} = T_{\text{P}}$

> [!header] Propagation Delay of the Circuit

- Maximum propagational delay is the **longest delay** between an input changing value and the output changing value. The path that causes this delay is called the critical path.

> [!example] 
>> From the input $A$ to the output $G_{2}$ is the longest delay which is the critical path
>
> ![[Propagation Delay and Timing Diagrams-20240608181908462.webp]]
>> The critical path of the circuit is $40$ ns.

> [!example] 
>> Every digital circuit has a propgational delay $t_{p}$, so the longest path has the maximum delay i.e. critical path.
> 
> ![[Propagation Delay and Timing Diagrams-20240608182507915.webp]]
>> The propagational delay of the circuit is $3 t_{p}$ 

- The delay of the critical path is same as delay of the circuit. 
- Critical path imposes limits on the speed of the circuit.

> [!intuition] 
> If the propagation delay of a circuit i.e. $t_{p}$ of the critical path is $n$ nanoseconds, then wait for at least $n$ nanoseconds before changing an input, for the circuit to behave in a stabilized manner.

> [!example] 
> ![[Propagation Delay and Timing Diagrams-20240608183443734.webp]]
>> From input $A$ to output $F$, the propagational delay is the most i.e. $t_{p} = 30 \mathrm{ns}$, which is the propagational delay of the circuit.

> [!example] 
>> $X$ has two pulses, one is $2 \mu s$ wide and the other is $3 \mu s$ wide.
>> NAND gate has a propagational delay $\epsilon$.
>> $Y = X$ but its waveform is shifted by $1 \mu s$.

> [!summary] 

- The propagational delay of the critical path is the propagational delay of the entire circuit.
- If the given circuit (however complex) has a propagation delay of $n$ nanoseconds, then the ideal output waveform shifts to right by $n$ nanoseconds.
