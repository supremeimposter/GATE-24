# Carry Look Ahead Adder

Initially we have the bits of the binary numbers and $C_{0}$. A separate circuit is designed for carry calculation.
$C_{0}$ does not have to be $0$ always, because 4-bit adders can be used in combination to perform 64-bit addition.

## Cases of Carry output

> [!header] When carry is generated?

Do not consider the carry input as we do not know what is the carry input at that moment.

![[Carry Look Ahead Adder-20240627215042582.webp]]

When $a = 1 \cap b = 1$, $C_{out} = 1$.
A carry is generated when $a = 1$ and $b = 1$.

> [!header] When carry is propagated?

A carry from the previous stage is propagated to the next stage when both $a$ and $b$ are different.

![[Carry Look Ahead Adder-20240627215126534.webp]]

When $a \oplus b = 1$, then $C_{in} = C_{out}$.

> [!header] When carry is killed?

When both $a$ and $b$ are $0$, then $C_{out} = 0$ even if $C_{in} = 0$ or $1$.
When $\overline{a} . \overline{b} = 1$, then $C_{out} = 0$.

## CLA construction

There are two variables defined for Carry Look-ahead Adder,
1. Carry Generate $G_i = a_i \,.\, b_i$ i.e. carry is generated when both bits are 1 independent of other stages.
2. Carry Propagate $P_i = a_i \oplus b_i$ i.e. carry input propagates to the next stage when both bits are different.

> [!convention] 
> $C_{i}$ is the carry input of the current stage.
> $C_{i + 1}$ is the carry output of the current stage and carry input of the next stage.

Both of these variables can be calculated without waiting for anything.

Assume that the propagational delay of NOT, AND, OR gates are $t$.
The propagational delay of $G_{i} = t$ and the propagational delay of $P_{i} = 3\,t$ if variables are not available in complementary form.

### Carry Generator Circuit

Now we calculate the carry out $C_{i + 1}$ of the current stage $i$.

For carry out of the current stage $C_{i + 1}$ to be $1$, either carry has to be generated ($a_{i} . b_{i} = 1$) or the carry input which is $1$ to the current stage has to be propagated ($a \oplus b = 1$). to the next stage.
$$
\begin{split}
C_{i + 1} 
&= \underbrace{G_{i}}_{\text{either generated}} + \underbrace{P_{i} \,.\, C_{i}}_{\text{or propagated when previous carry-in is } 1}  \\ \\

C_{1} 
&= G_{0} + P_{0} \, . \, C_{0} \\ \\

C_{2} 
&= G_{1} + P_{1} \, . \, C_{1} \\
&= G_{1} + P_{1} \, . \, (G_{0} + P_{0} \, . \, C_{0}) \\
&= G_{1} + P_{1} . G_{0} + P_{1} . P_{0} . C_{0} \\ \\

C_{3}
&= G_{2} + P_{2} \, . \, C_{2} \\
&= G_{2} + P_{2} \, . \, (G_{1} + P_{1} . G_{0} + P_{1} . P_{0} . C_{0}) \\
&= G_{2} + P_{2} . G_{1} + P_{2} . P_{1} . G_{0} + P_{2} . P_{1} . P_{0} . C_{0} \\ \\

C_{4}
&= G_{3} + P_{3} \,.\, C_{3} \\
&= G_{3} + P_{3} \,.\, (G_{2} + P_{2} . G_{1} + P_{2} . P_{1} . G_{0} + P_{2} . P_{1} . P_{0} . C_{0}) \\
&= G_{3} + P_{3} . G_{2} + P_{3} . P_{2} . G_{1} + P_{3} . P_{2} . P_{1} . G_{0} + P_{3} . P_{2} . P_{1} . P_{0} . C_{0}
\end{split}
$$

All of the $C_{i}$ can be calculated using the data available at initial stage, but the hardware requirements increases proportional to the number of bits.

Carry generator circuit can be implemented as a 2-level AND, OR circuit to find each $C_{i}$.

![[Carry Look Ahead Adder-20240627232020643.webp]]

Each $C_{i}$ has $(i + 1)$ product terms, so OR gate of each $C_{i}$ requires $(i + 1)$ inputs i.e. fan-in of the OR gate that sums up the product terms is $(i + 1)$. 

The maximum fan-in of an AND gate is $(i + 1)$, since one of the product terms will have $(i + 1)$ literals.

![[Carry Look Ahead Adder-20240627230204865.webp|Carry Generation circuit for $C2$]]

Each $C_{i}$ has only 1 OR gate and $i$ AND gates.

### Sum Generator Circuit

Since we know the equation of sum,
$$
\begin{split}
S_{i} 
&= a_{i} \oplus b_{i} \oplus  C_{i} \\ 
&= (a_{i} \oplus b_{i}) \oplus  C_{i} \\ 
S_{i} &= P_{i} \oplus  C_{i} \\  \\

S_{0}
&= P_{0} \oplus  C_{0} \\

S_{1}
&= P_{1} \oplus  C_{1} \\

S_{2}
&= P_{2} \oplus  C_{2} \\

S_{3}
&= P_{3} \oplus  C_{3} \\
\end{split}
$$
Each $S_{i}$ has only 1 ExOR gates, which can implemented as a single level ExOR circuit.

## Propagational delay of CLA circuit

Assume that the propagational delay of basic gates is $t$ and the fan-in of any gates are unlimited (Practically they cannot be unlimited).

![[Carry Look Ahead Adder-20240628165155907.webp]]

$P_{i}$ is available after $3\,t$ and $G_{i}$ is available after $t$.

![[Carry Look Ahead Adder-20240628165204737.webp]]

The carry generator circuit is implemented in two level AND-OR implementation, it has a propagational delay of $2\,t$.

![[Carry Look Ahead Adder-20240628165217163.webp]]

Every carry is available after $5\,t$, if ExOR is implemented as 3-level NOT, AND, OR implementation.

Every sum is available after $(5 + 3)\,t = 8\,t$.

![[Carry Look Ahead Adder-20240628165711580.webp|Propgational delay of CLA when fan-in is unlimited]]

For any n-bit CLA, the propagational delay is $8\,t$ if the propagational delay of all the basic gates is $t$ and only basic gates with unlimited fan-ins are used to implement the circuit.

All the carry-bits are valid after $5\,t$ and all the sum-bits are valid after $8\,t$.

When fan-in is limited by $k$, then the propagational delay of the **carry generator circuit** in an $n$-bit CLA is $\mathcal{O}(\log_{k} \,n)$ and the rest of the circuits take constant time for any $n$-bits.
