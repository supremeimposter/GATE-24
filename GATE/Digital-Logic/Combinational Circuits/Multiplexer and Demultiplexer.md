# Multiplexer

- Multiplexer (MUX) is a <mark style="background-color: #fff88f; color: black">data selector</mark> which works like a **bridge**.
- Every MUX is a $2^n \times 1$ MUX, where $n$ is the number of select lines or control inputs and there are $2^n$ number of inputs.
- It is a combinational circuit which selects one of the $2^n$ data inputs are transmits the information from that line to the output line.
- Every MUX has only one output line (because it is the design of this digital circuit).

> [!analogy] 
>> Think of MUX as a bridge where inputs are waiting at each gates and the control inputs check the ID number for each gateway. At a time, only one input can cross the bridge.

The output line is dependent on the input and the control lines i.e. $f(S_{0}, S_{1}, I_{0}, I_{1}, I_{2}, I_{3})$.

$2 \times 1$ MUX is a [[Functional Completeness|functionaly complete]] digital circuit i.e. any boolean function can be implemeneted using only $2 \times 1$ MUX.

## 4 X 1 MUX

![[Multiplexer and Demultiplexer-20240604103239707.webp]]
![[Multiplexer and Demultiplexer-20240604103255786.webp]]

The MUX circuit can be built from SOP expression.
![[Multiplexer and Demultiplexer-20240604105245907.webp]]

$4 \times 1$ MUX is a [[Functional Completeness|functionaly complete]] digital circuit i.e. any boolean function can be implemeneted using only $4 \times 1$ MUX.

## $2^n \times 1$ MUX

![[Multiplexer and Demultiplexer-20240604105520882.webp]]

The general equation for the output of the MUX with $n$ control inputs and $2^n$ data inputs is,
$$
F = \sum_{k=0}^{2^n - 1} \; m_{k} I_{k}
$$
where $m_{k}$ is the minterm of the $n$ control variables and $I_{k}$ is the corresponding data input.

A combination of MUX can be used to select data inputs.

## Realization of functions from MUX

The output of a MUX is a realized function or the function that is implemented.

Control inputs can also be fixed with either high or low inputs.

> [!example] 
> ![[Multiplexer and Demultiplexer-20240604114405635.webp]]

Control inputs can also pose as data inputs.

## Implemented Functions to MUX
> [!tip] 
> 1. Look at the given function carefully and do not use new variables for the select lines which are not in the given function.
> 2. If you are not getting any idea, then create the canonical SOP of the given function from the standard truth table to get the compact truth table and simplify the expression to get the MUX circuit.

A good MUX circuit should make use of input data and should have minimum invertors or never use one at all.

![[Multiplexer and Demultiplexer-20240604175654257.webp]]

An ideal MUX should use all the data input pins and should not add extra hardware e.g. $4 \times 1$ MUX for $a \oplus b$.

To the given function, you can apply the different inputs of the control inputs to see what is the value of $f$ and get to a conclusion about the MUX diagram.

> [!header] Single $2^n \times 1$ MUX is enough for any $n$-variable function

To implement a function of $n$ variables without using additional hardwares, a single $2^n \times 1$ MUX is enough, where $n$ is the number of control inputs. 
The truth table can be built using the inputs combinations of the $n$ variables.

For the data input lines, 
1. Connect `1` to MUX input line $I_{i}$ because it is a minterm of the function.
2. Otherwise connect `0` to MUX input line $I_{i}$.

> [!header] Single $2^{n-1} \times 1$ MUX is <mark class="hltr-cyan">not enough</mark> for any $n$-variable function

We need an Invertor in this case as additional hardware.

> [!example] 
>> $f = a \oplus b$ which is a 2 variable function requires a $2^{2-1} \times 1$ MUX and an invertor. A single $2 \times 1$ MUX is not enough.

There are some $n$ variable functions which can be implemented using $2^{n-1} \times 1$ MUX.


> [!example] 
>> $f(a, b) = a + \overline{b}$ is a function with $2$ variables and a single $2^{2-1} \times 1$ MUX is enough to implement $f$

> [!summary] 

- Not every 2 variable function can be implemented using single $2^{2-1} \times 1$ MUX without additional hardware.
- Some 2 variable function can be implemented using single $2^{2-1} \times 1$ MUX without additional hardware.

A function $f$ over $n$ variables can be implemented by,
1. a single $2^n \times 1$ MUX.
2. a single $2^{n-1} \times 1$ MUX + a single Invertor.
3. a single $2^{n-2} \times 1$ MUX + additional hardware e.g. OR, AND, NOT gates.

## Building Bigger MUX from Smaller MUX
> [!think] 
> A circuit manufacturing company may not manufacture your required MUX, for example, a $64 \times 1$ MUX cannot be manufactured by a company that manufactures $4 \times 1$ MUX in a large scale.

A single $4 \times 1$ MUX can be built using three $2 \times 1$ MUX.

![[Multiplexer and Demultiplexer-20240605215408538.webp]]

A single $8 \times 1$ MUX can be built using seven $2 \times 1$ MUX.

![[Multiplexer and Demultiplexer-20240606084334257.webp]]

A single $8 \times 1$ MUX can be built using three $4 \times 1$ MUX.

![[Multiplexer and Demultiplexer-20240606092838906.webp]]

A single $16 \times 1$ MUX is built using five $4 \times 1$ MUX.

![[Multiplexer and Demultiplexer-20240606102214478.webp]]

The control inputs must be configured accordingly or else we may not get the desired output.

> [!info] 
> When constructing a bigger MUX using smaller MUX, it requires a lot of hardware than constructing the bigger MUX itself.

Multiplexers can also be used to build some other useful digital circuits

A $2 \times 2$ cross bar switch can be built using a single $2 \times 2$ MUX.

## MUX with Enable Input
- Enable is like a switch to ON or OFF the MUX.

> [!analogy] 
> When laptop power button is OFF, no matter whatever keys you press on laptop, there is no response and no computation.
> When laptop power button is ON, laptop works normally.

![[Multiplexer and Demultiplexer-20240606125325000.webp]]


<u>Active High Enable</u>
- When the enable = 1, the MUX is ON i.e. MUX works normally.
- When the enable = 0, the MUX is OFF i.e. MUX is idle.

![[Multiplexer and Demultiplexer-20240606125356045.webp]]

<u>Active Low Enable</u>
- When the enable = 0, the MUX is ON i.e. MUX works normally.
- When the enable = 1, the MUX is OFF i.e. MUX is idle.

# Demultiplexer
- An output line is selected for the incoming data in the DEMUX.
- DEMUX is more like which output receives the incoming data. The incoming data can be either 0 or 1.

![[Multiplexer and Demultiplexer-20240606133338806.webp]]

A single $1 \times 2^n$ DEMUX has $n$ select lines, one input line and $2^n$ output data lines.

Data is received byte by byte  by a demux in a serial manner.
![[Multiplexer and Demultiplexer-20240606133535354.webp]]

In a DEMUX, each output line can be considered as a separate funciton depending on inputs and the control lines.
The input data (incoming data) can be either 0 or 1.

![[Multiplexer and Demultiplexer-20240606134953328.webp]]

> [!caution] 
> The input data $D$ can be either $0$ or $1$. Don't just put $1$ everywhere in place of $D$.

## 1 X 4 DEMUX

![[Multiplexer and Demultiplexer-20240606135935115.webp]]

For each output line, only for one input combination, it is set to the incoming data, others are set to $0$.
