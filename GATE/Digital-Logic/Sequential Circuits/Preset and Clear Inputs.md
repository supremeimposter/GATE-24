# Preset and Clear Inputs in Flip Flop

- Preset and Clear are active low inputs i.e. they work only when they are $0$.
- Preset and Clear are direct inputs since they do not care about other components when they are working.
- Preset and Clear do not care about the clock i.e. asynchronous by default.
- Preset and Clear are active low and asynchronous by default.

> [!conflict] Do not confuse active low with synchronous.
> Preset and Clear are active low in both asynchronous and synchronous flip flops.

## Implementation


## Synchronous Preset and Clear
