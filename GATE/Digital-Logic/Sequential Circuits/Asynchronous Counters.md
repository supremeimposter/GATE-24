# Asynchronous Counters
- Asynchronous counters are also called as Ripple counter.

## Frequency Division


## Transient States

- Due to the propagational delay of Flip flops, we get glitches called Transient States.
- Transient state occurs momentarily, when two bits are changing.
- LSB changes first and MSB changes next.
- Glitch occurs only for a moment, so they are not counted as states.

## Binary Down Ripple Counter

- For the counter to perform normally, before the next triggering edge, the settlement of the propagation delay has to be done.
- For proper functioning of any ripple counter of n flip flops, $n t_{pd} \le t_p$


## Binary (Up) Ripple Counter



## Cascading Counter
