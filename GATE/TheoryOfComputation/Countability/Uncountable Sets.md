# Uncountable Sets
- A set $S$ is uncountable iff $S$ is not countable.
- A set $S$ is uncountable iff $\mid S \mid \;\gt\; \mid \mathbb{N} \mid$ 

## Cantor's Diagonalization Argument

- If we proved that for an arbitrary bijection $f$ between $S$ and $\mathbb{N}$, there exists an element $x$ such that $x$ is not covered by $f$, then bijection does not exist between $S$ and $\mathbb{N}$.
