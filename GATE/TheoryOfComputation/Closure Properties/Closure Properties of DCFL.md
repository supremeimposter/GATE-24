# Closure Properties of DCFL

## Union Operation
- DCFLs are ***not necessarily*** closed under union property.

## Intersection Operation
- DCFLs are ***not necessarily*** closed under union property.

## Complement Operation
- DCFLs are closed under complementation operation.
- If $L$ is a DCFL, then $\overline{L}$ will always be a DCFL.

## Reversal Operation
- DCFLs are ***not necessarily*** closed under reversal operation.

## Set Difference Operation
- DCFLs are ***not necessarily*** closed under set difference operation.
