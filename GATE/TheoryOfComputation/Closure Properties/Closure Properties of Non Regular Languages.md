# Closure Properties of Non Regular Languages
- Base set is the set of all non regular languages.

## Complement Operation
- Non Regular languages are closed under complementation operation.

## Reverse Operation
- Non Regular languages are closed under reversal operation.

## Union Operation
- Non Regular languages are ***not necessarily*** closed under union operation.

## Intersection Operation
- Non Regular languages are ***not necessarily*** closed under union operation.

## Set Difference Operation
- Non Regular languages are ***not necessarily*** closed under set difference operation.

## Concatenation Operation
- Non Regular languages are ***not necessarily*** closed under concatenation operation.
- If $L \cdot M$ is non-regular, then at least one of them is non-regular.

## Kleene Star Operation
- Non Regular languages are ***not necessarily*** closed under kleene star operation.
