> [Closure Properties of RE, REC Languages | Complement of RE Language | Theory of Computation - Deepak - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ncabr1gpmes)

## Union Operation

- Recursive languages are closed under union operation.
- RE languages are closed under union operation.

## Intersection Operation

- Decidable languages are closed under intersection operation.
- RE languages are closed under intersection operation.

## Concatenation Operation


## Kleene Star Operation


## Complementation Operation
- RE languages ***may or may not*** be closed under complementation operation.
- Recursive languages are closed under complementation operation.
- $L$ and $\overline{L}$ are both RE ***iff*** $L$ and $\overline{L}$ are both recursive.
- If $L$ is RE but not REC, then $\overline{L}$ is not RE.
