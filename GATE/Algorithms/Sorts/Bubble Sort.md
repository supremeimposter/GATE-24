# Bubble Sort

For each pass, the largest element in the array gets bubbled up to the last position.
If there is no swapping in the internal loop *i.e. the array is already sorted or got sorted in the previous pass*, then the loop can be terminated early.

Bubble sort is in-place and stable algorithm.
