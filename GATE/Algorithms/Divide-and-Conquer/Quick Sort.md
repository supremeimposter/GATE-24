# Quick Sort

> [!abstract] 
> The main idea of quick sort is to put the pivot element in its place. Do not worry about the rest of the array.

Comparisons are done in the forward pass in the quick sort. The cost of combination is nothing i.e. $\mathcal{O}(1)$.
Quick sort in in-place, but not stable.
The probability of the worst case to occur in quick sort is very less.
