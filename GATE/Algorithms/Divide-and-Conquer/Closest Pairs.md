# Closest Pairs in 2D

If there are n points on a 2D plane, then what is the pair that has the minimum distance from each other. If there are $n$ points, then there are $n_{c_2}$ pairs on the 2D plane.

Initially sort the co-ordiantes based on either $x$ or $y$, which has a one time cost of $\mathcal{O}(n\;log_2n)$.
