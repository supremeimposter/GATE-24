- Power set of a set S is the set of all the subsets of S.
- Power set of $\Sigma^*$ is the set of all the subsets of $\Sigma^*$ i.e. Power set of $\Sigma^*$ is the set of all the languages.

- A language is regular if and only if there exists some [[Deterministic Finite Automata|DFA]] M such that $L = L(M)$
- A language which is recognised by DFA is called a regular language. A language which is not recognised by DFA is called a Non-regular language.
$$
\text{Regular Language } L \leftrightarrow L \text{ recognized by DFA}
$$
