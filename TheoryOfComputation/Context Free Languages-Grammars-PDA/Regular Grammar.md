# Regular Grammar
- A grammar which is either right linear grammar or left linear grammar is called a regular grammar.
- A regular grammar $G$ definitely generates a regular language $L(G)$.

- A grammar can be both right and left linear grammar.
$$
\begin{flalign}
S \rightarrow A \mid B\\ A \rightarrow a \\B \rightarrow B \mid b
\end{flalign}
$$
- Every regular grammar is a context free grammar.
- A non-regular grammar may or may not generate non-regular language.
