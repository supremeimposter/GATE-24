# Regular Grammar
- A grammar which is either right linear grammar or left linear grammar is called a regular grammar.
- A regular grammar $G$ definitely generates a regular language $L(G)$.

- A grammar can be both right and left linear grammar.

\begin{flalign}
S \rightarrow A \mid B\\ A \rightarrow a \\B \rightarrow B \mid b
\end{flalign}
$$
- Every regular grammar is a context free grammar.
- A non-regular grammar may or may not generate non-regular language.

- If there is a left linear grammar $G_1$, then there exists an equivalent right linear grammar $G_2$.
- If there is a right linear grammar $G_1$, then there exists an equivalent left linear grammar $G_2$.

> Do not confuse between equivalent grammar and equivalent language.
> Reversing the language does not produce equivalent language, but equivalent grammar.
