# Understanding Infinity

- Intuition does not work with infinite sets, unlike finite sets.
- Infinity works in a weird way.

# Cardinality

- A set is said to be **infinite**, if the set is not finite.
- For infinite sets, cardinality is not used to count the number of elements in the set, but to compare the sizes of two sets.

> [!remember] Do not apply your intuitions to infinite sets
