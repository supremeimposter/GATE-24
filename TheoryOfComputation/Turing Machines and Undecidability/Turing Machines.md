# Turing Machines
> [!attention] 
> Since there are many different definitions for Turing machine in various resources, questions are mostly avoided from TM. Only one standard definition is followed here which has been followed at IISc and Stanford.

> [!remember] 
> - Accepting a string is similar to solving a computational problem.
> - Turing Machine is the most powerful computational machine.

- Turing Machine (TM) = FA + Infinite tape
- Tape is ***not*** the input tape. Tape is a data structure of infinite number of cells for turing machine.
- TM has a finite set of states.
- TM has a unique initial state, a unique final state and a unique rejecting state.

> [!NOTE] 
> Statements such as "Every DFA is a TM", "Every PDA is a TM" signifies lack of knowledge or a lack in understanding.
