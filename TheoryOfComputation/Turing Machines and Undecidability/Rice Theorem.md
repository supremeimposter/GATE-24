# Rice Theorem
> [!youtube] 
> [Lecture 16C - Rice Theorem | Undecidability | Unrecognizability | Theory of Computation - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SeZIr2sVQ4)

- Rice theorem is applicable only on the properties of languages of Turing Machine.


> [!header] When Rice theorem is ***NOT*** applicable?


> [!header] Trivial and Non-Trivial Property

- All non-trivial properties of RE languages are undecidable.
- All trivial properties of RE languages are decidable.

> [!NOTE] 
> Trivial properties of anything is desirable, because it is trivial. Its a straight ***YES*** or ***NO***.

> [!header] Monotonic and Non-monotonic Property

- Every trivial property is monotonic, but the converse is ***NOT*** true.
