# Language and Decision Problem

> [!abstract] 
> Every Language is a Decision Problem and every Decision Problem is a Language.

- Every  Problem which has a Yes or No solution is a decision problem.
- For a decision problem $P$, the domain is the set of all possible inputs.
- For every problem $P$, we have a corresponding language $L$ i.e. Solving problem $P$ means recognizing language $L$.
- Turing Machines can do everything an algorithm can do.

- If an algorithm exists for an encoding, then it is decidable.
