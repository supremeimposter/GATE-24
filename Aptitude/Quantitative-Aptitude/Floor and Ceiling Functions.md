- If $x$ is a real number then,
	- $floor(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor$ is the greatest integer $n$ that is $\le x$ (go to the left of $x$ in the number line and find the nearest integer that is $\le x$) 
	- $ceil(x) = \lceil x \rceil$ is the least integer $n$ that is $\ge x$ (go to the right of $x$ in the number line and find the nearest integer that is $\ge x$) 
$$
\lfloor x \rfloor \le x \le \lceil x \rceil
$$
- If $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ then $\lfloor a \rfloor = a = \lceil a \rceil$ 
- floor is called the "greatest  integer function" and ceil is called "least integer function".
