# Join
- Join is also called as Inner Join
- There are three types of inner join
	1. Conditional Join ${} R \bowtie_c S {}$
	2. Equi Join
	3. [[Natural Join]] ${} R \bowtie S {}$

## Conditional Join

$$
R \bowtie_c S \equiv \sigma_c \;(R \times S)
$$
- The above transformation does not occurs, as there are joining algorithms to perform joins
- The schema of ${} R \bowtie_c S {}$ is same as schema of ${} R \times S {}$.
- âŸ—
- There is NO dangling row when each tuple in both the relations occurs in the resultant relation at least one time.

## Equi Join
- Conditional join is called Equi join, if $c {}$ only contains equality condition.
- Every Equi join is a conditional join.

## Natural Join
![[Natural Join#Natural Join]]
- There is no redundant attribute in natural join.

- Relations $R, S, Q {}$ all have different schema.
- ${} \frac{R}{S} = Q {}$ , ${} Q$ is the largest relation such that $Q \times S \subseteq R$
- To define $\frac{R}{S} {}$, attributes ($R$) ${} \supset {}$ attributes ($S$)
