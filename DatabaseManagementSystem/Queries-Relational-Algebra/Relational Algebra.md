# Relational Algebra
> [!lecture] Lecture-1

- Queries can be written using schema but evaluation is done by instance.
- Attributes can be accessed using the position number.
- Both inputs and output are instances.

## Analogy to Mathematical Algebra
- Values are needed to evaluate variables.
- Some operators can be derived from other operators.
- Schema (Relation) are analogous to variables and instances are analogous to values.

## Operators in Relational Algebra
- There are unary and binary operators in Relational Algebra.
- Unary takes one table as input and binary takes two tables as input.
