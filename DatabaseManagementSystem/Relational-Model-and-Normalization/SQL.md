# SQL
- SQL is the standard relational database language.
- SQL has two sub-languages,
	1. Data Definition sub-Language (DDL) - deals with schema
	2. Data Manipulation sub-Language (DML) - deals with data (tuples) and querying

## SQL vs Relational Model
- SQL is different from [[Relational Model]]

## [[DDL and DML]]
