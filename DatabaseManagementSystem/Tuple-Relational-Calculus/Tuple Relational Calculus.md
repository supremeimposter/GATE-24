# Tuple Relational Calculus
> [!lecture] Lecture-1

- In Relational Calculus, every variable is a tuple.
- There are two ways to write every TRC query.

## Way 1

## Way 2
- Result $\rightarrow {}$ Logic
- From the resultant relation $A$ out of ${} R {}$, we write a query for a tuple $t$ in ${} A$.
- The schema of a tuple $t$ is $A$.
