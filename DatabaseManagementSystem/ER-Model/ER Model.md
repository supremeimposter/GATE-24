- **Entity** = a distinguishable object
- **Relationship** = Association between entities
- **Attributes** = Description of Entities; Properties of Entity
- **Entity set** or **Entity Type** = Set of similar entities; entities with same attributes
- **Relationship Set** = Set of similar relationships; relationship between same entity types.

- Two entity types must have different names.
- The concept of [[Relational Model#Keys|keys]] in ER model is same as Relational model.
